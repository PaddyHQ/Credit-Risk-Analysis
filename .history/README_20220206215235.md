# Supervised-Learning
## Purpose
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans.
you’ll oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, you’ll use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm.

Next, you’ll compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias,BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk
